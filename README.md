- From the data, We can see that the vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically significant and provide the model a lot of variety. Weight, spoiler angle, and AWD all have large p-values, implying that these are random variations.
- With an r-square of 0.68, we may infer that the mpg can be anticipated about (68%) of the time.
